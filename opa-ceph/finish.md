This scenario showed how OPA can be used to enforce custom policies over the S3 API to the Ceph Storage Cluster. You can modify OPA's polices to get greater control over the actions performed on the Ceph Object Storage without making any changes to Ceph.

This tutorial also showed how OPA can seamlessly work with Rook without any modifications to Rook's components.
