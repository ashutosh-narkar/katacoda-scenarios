This scenario showed how you can leverage OPA to enforce admission control decisions in Kubernetes clusters without modifying or recompiling any Kubernetes components. Furthermore, once Kubernetes is configured to use OPA as an External Admission Controller, policies can be modified on-the-fly to satisfy changing operational requirements.
